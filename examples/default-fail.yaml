    This is a simple pipeline to demonstrate failure in a step.

    step 1 >> step 2 (FAIL) >> fail

    The default behavior is to traverse to step type fail and mark the run as failed.

    You can control the flow by using on_failure, please check example/on-failure.yaml

    You can run this pipeline by runnable execute -f examples/default-fail.yaml
  start_at: step 1
  steps:
    step 1:
      type: stub
      next: step 2
    step 2:
      type: task
      command_type: shell
      command: exit 1 # This will fail
      next: step 3
    step 3:
      type: stub
      next: success
    success:
      type: success
    fail:
      type: fail
