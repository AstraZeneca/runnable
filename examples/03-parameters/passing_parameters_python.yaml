    The below example shows how to set/get parameters in python
    tasks of the pipeline.

    The function, set_parameter, returns
        - simple python data types (int, float, str)
        - pydantic models
        - pandas dataframe, any "object" type

    pydantic models are implicitly handled by runnable
    but "object" types should be marked as "pickled".

    Use pickled even for python data types is advised for
    reasonably large collections.
  start_at: write_parameters
  steps:
    write_parameters:
      type: task
      command: examples.common.functions.write_parameter
      returns:
        - name: df
          kind: object
        - name: integer
        - name: floater
        - name: stringer
        - name: pydantic_param
        - name: score

      next: read_parameters
    read_parameters:
      type: task
      command: examples.common.functions.read_parameter
      next: success
    success:
      type: success
    fail:
      type: fail
