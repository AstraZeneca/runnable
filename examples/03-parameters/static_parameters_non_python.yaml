    The below example showcases setting up known initial parameters for a pipeline
    of notebook and shell based commands.

    The initial parameters as defined in the yaml file are:
        integer: 1
        floater : 3.14
        stringer : hello
        pydantic_param:
          x: 10
          foo: bar

    runnable exposes the nested parameters as dictionary for notebook based tasks
    and as a json string for the shell based tasks.

    You can set the initial parameters from environment variables as well.
    eg: Any environment variable prefixed by "RUNNABLE_PRM_" will be picked up by runnable


    Run this pipeline as:
      runnable execute -f 03-parameters/static_parameters_non_python.yaml \
        -p common/initial_parameters.yaml

  start_at: read_params_in_notebook
  steps:
    read_params_in_notebook:
      type: task
      command_type: notebook
      command: examples/common/read_parameters.ipynb
      next: read_params_in_shell
    read_params_in_shell:
      type: task
      command_type: shell
      command: |
        if [ "$integer" = 1 ] \
          && [ "$floater" = 3.14 ] \
          && [ "$stringer" = "hello" ] \
          && [ "$pydantic_param" = '{"x": 10, "foo": "bar"}' ]; then
              echo "yaay"
              exit 0;
          else
              echo "naay"
              exit 1;
        fi
      next: success
