    You can run this pipeline by:
       runnable execute -f examples/01-tasks/python_tasks.yaml

       The stdout of "Hello World!" would be captured as 
       execution log and stored in the catalog.
        
        An example of the catalog structure:

        .catalog
        └── baked-heyrovsky-0602
            └── hello.execution.log

        2 directories, 1 file
        
        The hello.execution.log has the captured stdout of "Hello World!".
  start_at: hello_task
  steps:
    hello_task:
      type: task # The functional unit of the pipeline which does the work.
      command: examples.common.functions.hello # dotted path to the function.
      next: success # If this function succeeds, mark the pipeline as success
    success:
      type: success
    fail:
      type: fail
