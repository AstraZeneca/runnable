    This is a sample pipeline with one step that executes a shell command.

    You can run this pipeline by:
    runnable execute -f examples/01-tasks/scripts.yaml

    The command can be anything that can be executed in a shell.
    The stdout/stderr of the execution is captured as execution log and
    stored in the catalog.

    For example:
    .catalog
    └── seasoned-perlman-1355
        └── hello.execution.log

  start_at: notebook
  steps:
    notebook:
      type: task
      command_type: shell
      command: echo "hello world!!" # The path is relative to the root of the project.
      next: success
    success:
      type: success
    fail:
      type: fail
