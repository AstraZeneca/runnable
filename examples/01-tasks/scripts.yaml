    This is a sample pipeline with one step that
    executes a shell command.

    You can run this pipeline by:
    runnable execute -f examples/01-tasks/scripts.yaml

    For example:
    .catalog
    └── seasoned-perlman-1355
        └── hello.execution.log

  start_at: shell
  steps:
    shell:
      type: task
      command_type: shell
      command: echo "hello world!!" # The path is relative to the root of the project.
      next: success
