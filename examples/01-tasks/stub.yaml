    This is a simple pipeline that does 3 steps in sequence.

    step 1 >> step 2 >> step 3 >> success

    All the steps are mocked and they will just pass through.
    Use this pattern to define the skeleton of your pipeline
    and flesh out the steps later.

    Note that you can give any arbitrary keys to the steps
    (like step 2).
    This is handy to mock steps within mature pipelines.

    You can run this pipeline by:
       runnable execute -f examples/01-tasks/stub.yaml
  start_at: step 1
  steps:
    step 1:
      type: stub # This will always succeed
      next: step 2
    step 2:
      type: stub
      what: is this thing? # It takes arbitrary keys
      It: does not matter!!
      next: step 3
    step 3:
      type: stub
      next: success
