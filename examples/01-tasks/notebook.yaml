    This is a sample pipeline with one step that executes a notebook.

    The notebook is executed in the same environment so any installed
    packages are available for the notebook.

    Upon successful execution, the output notebook with cell outputs
    is stored in the catalog.

    You can run this pipeline as:
      runnable execute -f examples/01-tasks/notebook.yaml

  start_at: hello
  steps:
    hello:
      type: task
      command_type: notebook
      command: examples/common/simple_notebook.ipynb # The path is relative to the root of the project.
      next: success
