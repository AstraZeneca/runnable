    This is a sample pipeline with one step that executes a notebook.

    The notebook is executed in the same environment so any installed
    packages are available for the notebook.

    Upon successful execution, the output notebook with cell outputs
    is stored in the catalog.

    For example, the catalog structure for this execution would be:

    .catalog
    └── meek-rosalind-0853
        ├── examples
        │   └── common
        │       └── simple_notebook_out.ipynb
        └── notebook.execution.log

    The notebook simple_notebook_<step_name>_out.ipynb has the captured stdout of "Hello World!".

    You can run this pipeline as:
      runnable execute -f examples/01-tasks/notebook.yaml

  start_at: notebook
  steps:
    notebook:
      type: task
      command_type: notebook
      command: examples/common/simple_notebook.ipynb # The path is relative to the root of the project.
      next: success
