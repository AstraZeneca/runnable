    map states allows to repeat a branch for each value of an iterable.

    The below example can written, in python, as:

    chunks = [1, 2, 3]

    for chunk in chunks:
        # Any task within the pipeline can access the value of chunk as an argument.
        processed = process_chunk(chunk)

        # The value of processed for every iteration is the value returned by the steps
        # of the current execution. For example, the value of processed
        # for chunk=1, is chunk*10 = 10 for downstream steps.
        read_processed_chunk(chunk, processed)

    It is possible to use a custom reducer, for example, this reducer is a max of the collection.
    # Once the reducer is applied, processed is reduced to a single value.
    assert processed == max(chunk * 10 for chunk in chunks)

    Run this pipeline as:
      runnable execute -f examples/07-map/custom_reducer.yaml \
      -p examples/common/initial_parameters.yaml
  start_at: map_state
  steps:
    map_state:
      type: map
      branch: *branch
      iterate_on: chunks
      iterate_as: chunk
      reducer: "lambda *x: max(x)"
      next: collect
    collect:
      type: task
      command: examples.common.functions.assert_custom_reducer
      next: success
