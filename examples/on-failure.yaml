    This is a simple pipeline to demonstrate failure in a step.

    The default behavior is to traverse to step type fail and mark the run as failed.
    But you can control it by providing on_failure.

    In this example: step 1 fails and moves to step 3 skipping step 2. The pipeline status
    is considered to be success.

    step 1 (FAIL) >> step 3 >> success

    You can run this pipeline by runnable execute -f examples/on-failure.yaml
  start_at: step 1
  steps:
    step 1:
      type: task
      command_type: shell
      command: exit 1 # This will fail!
      next: step 2
      on_failure: step 3
    step 2:
      type: stub # This step will never reach
      next: step 3
    step 3:
      type: stub
      next: success
    success:
      type: success
    fail:
      type: fail
