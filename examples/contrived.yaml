    This is a stubbed pipeline that does 4 steps in sequence.
    All the steps are mocked and they will just pass through.
    Use this pattern to define the skeleton of your pipeline and flesh out the steps later.

    You can run this pipeline by runnable execute -f examples/contrived.yaml

  start_at: Acquire data
  steps:
    Acquire data:
      type: stub # (1)
      next: Prepare data # (2)
    Prepare data:
      type: stub
      next: Extract features
    Extract features:
      type: stub
      next: Model
    Model:
      type: stub
      next: success
    success: # (3)
      type: success
    fail: # (4)
      type: fail
