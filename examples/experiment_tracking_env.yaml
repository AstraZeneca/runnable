    An example pipeline to demonstrate setting experiment tracking metrics
    using environment variables. Any environment variable with prefix
    'runnable_TRACK_' will be recorded as a metric captured during the step.

    You can run this pipeline as:
      runnable execute -f examples/concepts/experiment_tracking_env.yaml \
      -c examples/configs/mlflow-config.yaml

    The mlflow server is expected to be running at http://127.0.0.1:8080
