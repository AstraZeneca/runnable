    This is a simple pipeline that does 2 parallel branches at step 2.
    step1 inside branch_a fails resulting in step2 to fail and eventually the graph.

    Note that the branches schema is same as dag schema.

    You can run this pipeline by:
       runnable execute -f examples/parallel-fail.yaml
  start_at: step 1
  steps:
    step 1:
      type: stub
      next: step 2
    step 2:
      type: parallel
      next: step 3
      branches:
        branch_a:
          start_at: step 1
          steps:
            step 1:
              type: task
              command_type: shell
              command: exit 1 # This will fail
              next: step 2
            step 2:
              type: stub
              next: success
            success:
              type: success
            fail:
              type: fail
        branch_b:
          start_at: step 1
          steps:
            step 1:
              type: stub
              next: step 2
            step 2:
              type: stub
              next: success
            success:
              type: success
            fail:
              type: fail
    step 3:
      type: stub
      next: success
    success:
      type: success
    fail:
      type: fail
