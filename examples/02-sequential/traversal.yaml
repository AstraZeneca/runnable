    A pipeline can have any "tasks" as part of it. In the
    below example, we have a mix of stub, python, shell and notebook tasks.

    As with simpler tasks, the stdout and stderr of each task are captured
    and stored in the catalog.

    runnable execute -f examples/02-sequential/traversal.yaml

  start_at: hello stub # (1)
  steps:
    hello stub:
      type: stub
      next: hello python # (2)
    hello python:
      type: task
      command_type: python
      command: examples.common.functions.hello # dotted path to the function.
      next: hello shell
    hello shell:
      type: task
      command_type: shell
      command: echo "Hello World!" # Command to run
      next: hello notebook
    hello notebook:
      type: task
      command_type: notebook
      command: examples/common/simple_notebook.ipynb # The path is relative to the root of the project.
      next: success # (3)
