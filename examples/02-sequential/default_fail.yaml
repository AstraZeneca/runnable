    This is a simple pipeline to demonstrate failure in a step.

    step 1 >> step 2 (FAIL) >> fail

    The default behavior is to traverse to step type fail and mark the run as failed.

    You can run this pipeline by:
      runnable execute -f examples/02-sequential/default_fail.yaml
  start_at: step 1
  steps:
    step 1:
      type: stub
      next: step 2
    step 2:
      type: task
      command_type: python
      command: examples.common.functions.raise_ex # This will fail
      next: step 3
    step 3:
      type: stub # This will never execute
      next: success
