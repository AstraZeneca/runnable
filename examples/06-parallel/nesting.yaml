    Use this pattern to define repeatable branch

    This pipeline is similar to one defined in:
      examples/02-sequential/traversal.yaml
  start_at: hello stub
  steps:
    hello stub:
      type: stub
      next: hello python
    hello python:
      type: task
      command_type: python
      command: examples.common.functions.hello # dotted path to the function.
      next: hello shell
    hello shell:
      type: task
      command_type: shell
      command: echo "Hello World!" # Command to run
      next: hello notebook
    hello notebook:
      type: task
      command_type: notebook
      command: examples/common/simple_notebook.ipynb # The path is relative to the root of the project.
      next: success


# This branch is similar to a branch parallel.yaml
nested_branch: &nested_branch
  start_at: parallel_step
  steps:
    parallel_step:
      type: parallel
      next: success
      branches:
        branch1: *simple_branch
        branch2: *simple_branch


# The pipeline of nested parallel branches
dag:
  start_at: parallel_step
  steps:
    parallel_step:
      type: parallel
      next: success
      branches:
        branch1: *nested_branch
        branch2: *nested_branch
