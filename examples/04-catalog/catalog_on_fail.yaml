    Demonstrates moving files within tasks.

    - generate_data: creates df.csv and data_folder/data.txt

    - delete_local_after_generate: deletes df.csv and data_folder/data.txt
        This step ensures that the local files are deleted after the step

    - read_data_py: reads df.csv and data_folder/data.txt

    - delete_local_after_python_get: deletes df.csv and data_folder/data.txt
        This step ensures that the local files are deleted after the step

    - read_data_shell: reads df.csv and data_folder/data.txt

    - delete_local_after_shell_get: deletes df.csv and data_folder/data.txt
        This step ensures that the local files are deleted after the step

    - read_data_notebook: reads df.csv and data_folder/data.txt

    - delete_local_after_notebook_get: deletes df.csv and data_folder/data.txt

    Use this pattern to move files that are not dill friendly.

    All the files are stored in catalog.

    Run this pipeline as:
      runnable execute -f examples/04-catalog/catalog.yaml
  start_at: fail_immediately
  steps:
    fail_immediately:
      type: task
      command_type: shell
      command: |
        touch df.csv && \
        exit 1
      catalog:
        put:
          - df.csv
          - data_folder/data.txt
      next: success
      on_failure: success node
    success node:
      type: stub
      next: success
