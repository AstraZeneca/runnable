dag:
  description: |
    This is a stubbed pipeline that demonstrates parallel
    pipeline execution.
    Note that the branches schema is same as dag schema.

    All the steps are mocked and they will just pass through.
    Use this pattern to define the skeleton of your pipeline and
    flesh out the steps later.

    You can run this pipeline by:
       magnus execute -f examples/concepts/parallel.yaml
  start_at: Get Features
  steps:
    Get Features:
      type: stub
      next: Train Models
    Train Models:
      type: parallel
      next: Ensemble Modelling
      branches:
        XGBoost:
          start_at: Prepare for XGBoost
          steps:
            Prepare for XGBoost:
              type: stub
              next: Train XGBoost
            Train XGBoost:
              type: stub
              next: XGBoost success
            XGBoost success:
              type: success
            fail:
              type: fail
        RF model:
          start_at: Train RF Model
          steps:
            Train RF Model:
              type: stub
              next: RF Model Success
            RF Model Success:
              type: success
            fail:
              type: fail
    Ensemble Modelling:
      type: stub
      next: Run Inference
    Run Inference:
      type: stub
      next: success
    success:
      type: success
