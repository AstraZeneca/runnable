    This is a stubbed pipeline that does 3 steps in sequence.
    All the steps are mocked and they will just pass through.
    Use this pattern to define the skeleton of your pipeline
    and flesh out the steps later.

    You can run this pipeline by:
    runnable execute -f examples/pipelines/traversal.yaml

  start_at: step 1
  steps:
    step 1:
      type: stub
      next: step 2
    step 2:
      type: stub
      next: step 3
    step 3:
      type: stub
      next: success
    success:
      type: success
    fail:
      type: fail
