    This is a sample pipeline with one step that executes a shell command.

    The step name "shell" has the "command_type" to be shell to
    let runnable know to execute a shell while the command is directly
    executed in the current environment.

    You can run this pipeline as:
      runnable execute -f examples/concepts/task_shell_simple.yaml

  start_at: shell
  steps:
    shell:
      type: task
      command_type: shell
      command: echo "Hello world!!"
      next: success
    success:
      type: success
    fail:
      type: fail
