    This pipeline demonstrates the usage of map state to dynamically
    execute workflows in parallel.

    The step "chunk files" identifies the total number of batches to
    execute in parallel and sets the parameters
     - start_index of every batch to process, chunks
     - number of files to process per batch, stride.

    The step "iterate and execute" iterates on "chunks" and the
    parameter name per chunk is set to be "start_index".

    The shell script can access the start_index as
    runnable_MAP_VARIABLE environment variable.

    Run this pipeline by:
      runnable execute -f examples/concepts/map_shell.yaml

  start_at: chunk files
  steps:
    chunk files:
      type: task
      command_type: shell

        - chunks

        export stride=10 &&
        export chunks="[0, 10, 20, 30, 40]"
