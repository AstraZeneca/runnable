    In this type of Run Log store, we use a file system to store the JSON run log.

    Every single run is stored as a different file which makes it compatible across other store types.

    When to use:
        When locally testing a pipeline and have the need to compare across runs.
        Its fully featured and perfectly fine if your local environment is where you would do everything.

    Do not use:
        If you need parallelization on local, this run log would not support it.

    Example config:

    run_log:
      type: file-system
      config:
        log_folder: The folder to out the logs. Defaults to .run_log_store
