# Getting Started Tutorial

Transform a simple machine learning function into a production-ready pipeline, solving real challenges along the way.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

- ✅ **Reproducible ML pipeline**: Automatic tracking of all runs and results
- ✅ **Configurable experiments**: Change parameters without touching code
- ✅ **Multi-step workflow**: Data loading → preprocessing → training → evaluation
- ✅ **Large dataset handling**: Efficient storage and retrieval of data artifacts
- ✅ **Shareable results**: Model artifacts and metrics that persist between runs
- ✅ **Deployment ready**: Same pipeline runs on laptop, containers, or Kubernetes

## The Journey

Each chapter tackles a real problem you'll face moving from "works on my laptop" to production:

1. **[The Starting Point](01-starting-point.md)** - A typical ML function with common problems
2. **[Making It Reproducible](02-making-it-reproducible.md)** - Track everything automatically
3. **[Adding Flexibility](03-adding-flexibility.md)** - Configure without code changes
4. **[Connecting the Workflow](04-connecting-workflow.md)** - Multi-step ML pipeline
5. **[Handling Large Datasets](05-handling-datasets.md)** - Efficient data management
6. **[Sharing Results](06-sharing-results.md)** - Persistent model artifacts and metrics
7. **[Running Anywhere](07-running-anywhere.md)** - Same code, different environments

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Familiarity with scikit-learn (we'll use simple examples)
- Python environment with runnable installed: `pip install runnable[examples]`

**Time Investment**: ~30-45 minutes total, designed for step-by-step learning
